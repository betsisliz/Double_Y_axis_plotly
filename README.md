# Double_Y_axis_plotly
This repo contains a function that aligns the gridlines of plots with a double y axis created in plotly using R. This can be used for both positive and negative values. Simply source it :)

Big thanks to Victor, whose code has ben adapted to create this function https://github.com/VictorBezak/Plotly_Multi-Axes_Gridlines
